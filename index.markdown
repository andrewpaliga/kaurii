 	Permanently capture carbon dioxide via wood burial.

To avoid the worst effects of climate change, [most climate models](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9f) agree that we will need to **remove** 6 gigatons of carbon dioxide a year by 2050. To accomplish this, we need to develop and deploy technology that will remove carbon dioxide out of the air and store it permanently and securely for centuries to come.

### Vision

Our belief that some of the most effective ways to remove carbon dioxide from our atmosphere will be to leverage processes that already exist within nature. In particular, the carbon cycle of our forests.

Forests span 40 million square kilometres and cycle 220 Gt of carbon dioxide (700% of human emissions) a year. When trees live, they absorb carbon dioxide through their leaves and store in organic carbon form in their trunks and branches. When trees die, they decay and the carbon is released back into the atmosphere in the form of CO2.

Although the amount of carbon absorbed and stored in forests can change year to year from afforestation or deforestation (leading to annual changes of CO2), over the long term, mature forests are carbon neutral because an equal amount of CO2 is absorbed by growing trees as is released by dead trees.

Our vision is to recover a portion of the wood biomass and sequester it permanently to lock its carbon from reentering the atmosphere. If scaled sufficiently, a massive annual reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide could be achieved.

### How to stop trees from decaying?

When trees die, they primarily decay from biological processes, releasing carbon dioxide as a result. The main agents of this are fungi, insects and bacteria. The rate of decay is a function of moisture, temperature, oxygen content, and PH level.

By controlling these factors it’s possible to create an environment for where wood will forgo decay almost indefinitely. Burial is the most obvious candidate for this, as oxygen levels, and biological activity decreases exponentially beneath 1 m of soil in most areas. 

There are many examples of wood being recovered almost fully intact after many thousands of years of burial:

  - [2500 year old wooden coffin buried 1.5m almost fully intact](http://www.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/192520.htm)
  - [Ancient trees preserved for 50,000+ years in peat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_kauri) (Swamp Kauri)
  - [Trees up to 12,000 years old recovered from Missouri streams](https://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/2003/01/ancient-wood-uncovered?page=0,0)

With further research and experimentation, our aim is to pioneer a process for the low cost collection and burial for dead, and near-dead, wood biomass, at scale. Allowing for the semi-permanent (1000+ years) and secure sequestration of carbon within the organic matter.

### Out team

We are in the process of putting together a team of experts in soil science, atmospheric sciences, excavation and project management background.

To be published.


### Alpha Project

Once the right team is assembled, and further research is completed, we will commence a proof-of-concept project. Our target is to sequester 10,000 tons of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions at around $100 per ton. A small investment round will be completed at this time.

### Q&A

**How much carbon is contained within 1 kg of wood?**  
The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements by weight for dry wood. 

Once the carbon is released into the atmosphere through burning or decomposition, the carbon atom will bond with oxygen to form CO<sub>2</sub> at a weight ratio of 1 to 3.67. So the complete combustion of 1 kg of dry wood will result in approx 1.8 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>.

For our estimates, we are conservatively assuming 50% absolute moisture rate. So 1 kg of waste wood converts to approximately 0.9 kg of carbon dioxide emissions

**How much space will be required to store wood for the purpose of carbon capture?**  
A 100 m<sup>3</sup> cube of compressed would can store more than a million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. Volume of 3.16 km x 3.16 km x 0.1 km could store a gigaton of CO<sub>2</sub> (about 3% of 2019 human emissions)

**Why Kauri?**  
Our name was inspired from Ancient Kauri trees which are prehistoric [kauri trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agathis_australis) that have been preserved for up-to 50,000 years in an anaerobic and chemically balanced environment.
